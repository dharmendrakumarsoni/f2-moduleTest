# f2-moduleTest

The project aims to create an interactive recipe catalogue website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It involves displaying recipes from a provided JSON array, allowing users to search for recipes by name, toggle between veg and non-veg recipes, filter recipes based on ratings, and like individual recipes.

I have chosen a Figma design for the visualization of the project.
